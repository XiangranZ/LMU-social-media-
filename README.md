My website showcases my personal information, curriculum vitae (CV), and the contents we have leanred during the course. The website is styled in a pleasant and user-friendly manner to enhance user experience. I predominately used HTML and CSS for this website, but I have also included exercises that revolve around JavaScript.
- index.html: Homepage of my project. I imported a background image to enhance the vibrancy. 
- CV.html: Curriculum vitae page which showcases my educational and working experiences, qualifications and interests.
- Key Concepts.html: definitions of designing and online medias with a case study about instagram's UI/UX, features, target audience and more.
- Platform Architecture and Infrastructure.html: definitions and short summary of platform architecture and infrastructure concepts covered in the course with an team work exercise.
- Frontend Development.html: definitions and short summary of frontend development and its key technologies with two projects that I have accomplished in the course: my curriculum and a JavaScript exercise (Add into the previous example multiplication and division operations).
- Backend Development.html: Definitions of backend development and APIs with two case studies about Instagram and the C language. 
- Data Storage and Databases.html: Definitions of Data Storage and Databases and summary of different types of Database with a case study (Graph Database).
- Full web Application.html: Page presenting the concept of full web application development studied in the course.

I created a CSS file for each single web page. To ensure a certain uniformity, I have implemented the general stylesheet style.css for each individual webpage.
