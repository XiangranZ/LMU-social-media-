        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <h3>Platform Architecture</h3>
        <p>Platform architecture describes the overall design and structure of a platform, including the arrangement and interaction of components to realize specific functions.</p>
        <h3>Platform Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The underlying framework or physical components, such as hardware, software, and networks, that enable the operation of a platform.</p>
        <h3>Client/Server Architecture</h3>
        <p>Client refers to the end-user device or application that interacts with the server. Server refers to the centralized system or software that responds to client requests. Client/server architecture describes the relationship between clients and servers.</p>
        <h3>Client/Server Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Client/Server infrastructure enables communication between clients and servers. It supports the functioning of the architecture.</p>

        <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
        <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol for data exchange on the internet. It is used to transfer data between a web browser and a web server. When a user enters a URL into a web broswer, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server assoiated with that URL. Subsequently, the server responds with the requested web page or other resources.</p>
        <h3>TLS (Transport Layer Security)</h3>
        <p>TLS is a cryptographic protocol that protects internet communications. It creates secure conneitons between a client(e.g. a web browser) and a server.</p>
        <h3>DNS (Domain Name System)</h3> 
        <p>DNS translates domain names (e.g. wwww.wikipedia.com) into IP addresses that computer uses to identify each other on the internet. It enables web browsers to access websites and other internet resources.</p>
